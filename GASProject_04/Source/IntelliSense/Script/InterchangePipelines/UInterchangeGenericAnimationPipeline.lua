---@field public bImportAnimations boolean @If enable, import all animation assets find in the sources.
---@field public bImportBoneTracks boolean @Import bone transform tracks. If false, this will discard any bone transform tracks.
---@field public AnimationRange EInterchangeAnimationRange @Which animation range to import. The one defined at Exported, at Animated time or define a range manually
---@field public FrameImportRange FInt32Interval @Frame range used when Set Range is used in Animation Length
---@field public bUse30HzToBakeBoneAnimation boolean @If enabled, samples all animation curves to 30 FPS
---@field public CustomBoneAnimationSampleRate integer @Sample fbx animation data at the specified sample rate, 0 find automaticaly the best sample rate
---@field public bSnapToClosestFrameBoundary boolean @If enabled, snaps the animation to the closest frame boundary using the import sampling rate
---@field public bImportCustomAttribute boolean @If true, import node attributes as either Animation Curves or Animation Attributes
---@field public bAddCurveMetadataToSkeleton boolean @Whether to automatically add curve metadata to an animation's skeleton. If this is disabled, curve metadata will be added to skeletal meshes for morph targets, but no metadata entry will be created for general curves.
---@field public bSetMaterialDriveParameterOnCustomAttribute boolean @Set Material Curve Type for all custom attributes that exists
---@field public MaterialCurveSuffixes TArray<string> @Set Material Curve Type for the custom attribute with the following suffixes. This doesn't matter if Set Material Curve Type is true
---@field public bRemoveCurveRedundantKeys boolean @When importing custom attribute as curve, remove redundant keys
---@field public bDoNotImportCurveWithZero boolean @When importing custom attribute or morphtarget as curve, do not import if it doesn't have any value other than zero. This is to avoid adding extra curves to evaluate
---@field public bDeleteExistingNonCurveCustomAttributes boolean @If true, all previous node attributes imported as Animation Attributes will be deleted when doing a re-import.
---@field public bDeleteExistingCustomAttributeCurves boolean @If true, all previous node attributes imported as Animation Curves will be deleted when doing a re-import.
---@field public bDeleteExistingMorphTargetCurves boolean @If true, all previous morph target curves will be deleted when doing a re-import
---@field public SourceAnimationName string @Name of source animation that was imported, used to reimport correct animation from the translated source
---@field private bSceneImport boolean @Set as a property to carry this value over during a duplicate
