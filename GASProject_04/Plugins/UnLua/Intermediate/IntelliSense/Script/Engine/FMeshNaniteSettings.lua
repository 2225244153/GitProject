---Settings applied when building Nanite data.
---@class FMeshNaniteSettings
---@field public bEnabled boolean @If true, Nanite data will be generated.
---@field public bPreserveArea boolean @Whether to try and maintain the same surface area at all distances. Useful for foliage that thins out otherwise.
---@field public bExplicitTangents boolean @Whether to store explicit tangents instead of using the implicitly derived ones.
---@field public PositionPrecision integer @Position Precision. Step size is 2^(-PositionPrecision) cm. MIN_int32 is auto.
---@field public NormalPrecision integer @Normal Precision in bits. -1 is auto.
---@field public TangentPrecision integer @Tangent Precision in bits. -1 is auto.
---@field public TargetMinimumResidencyInKB integer @How much of the resource should always be resident (In KB). Approximate due to paging. 0: Minimum size (single page). MAX_uint32: Entire mesh.
---@field public KeepPercentTriangles number @Percentage of triangles to keep from source mesh. 1.0 = no reduction, 0.0 = no triangles.
---@field public TrimRelativeError number @Reduce until at least this amount of error is reached relative to size of the mesh
---@field public FallbackTarget ENaniteFallbackTarget @Which heuristic to use when generating the fallback mesh.
---@field public FallbackPercentTriangles number @Percentage of triangles to keep from source mesh for fallback. 1.0 = no reduction, 0.0 = no triangles.
---@field public FallbackRelativeError number @Reduce until at least this amount of error is reached relative to size of the mesh
---@field public DisplacementUVChannel integer @UV channel used to sample displacement maps
---@field public DisplacementMaps TArray<FMeshDisplacementMap>
