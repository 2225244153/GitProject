---* A mesh instance is a description of a translated scene node that point on a translated mesh asset.
---* A mesh instance pointing on a lod group can have many lods and many scene mesh nodes per lod index.
---* A mesh instance pointing on a mesh node will have only the lod 0 and will point on one scene mesh node.
